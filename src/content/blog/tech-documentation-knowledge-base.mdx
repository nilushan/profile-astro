I have finally found a way to host a free website and blog. I am hoping to blog my tech journeys here going forward.

## New Website

I have been looking into Static web site generators ( Jekyll , Eleventy), and ways to use website templates to learn how to host a good looking, fast website for free without using popular tools like wordpress that are too heavy and overkill for the purpose. 
Being a developer, writing in markup in a text editor is the prefered way to document, so this should be fine going forward.
