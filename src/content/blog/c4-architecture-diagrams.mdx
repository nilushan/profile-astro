I have always been a fan of  diagramming software systems. I have tried out many diagramming tools in the past. The most recent popular tool being Lucid charts. And then Draw.io. Due to some drawbacks of manually drawn diagrams, I have started to enjoyed diagrams as code. Initially there were sequence diagramming tools that supported defining the diagram as code. With time, it was possible to draw entire diagrams as code. 

I have been fond of C4 diagrams as it provides a layered and encapsulated view and architecture. You can start looking at the high level architecture and drill all the way down to the detailed level using C4. At first Icepanel.io introduced me to the concepts of C4. It was a good tool to learn about C4. How to define and draw a layered architecture diagram. Thereafter I tried out a few C4 diagramming tools that allow the diagram to be defined using code. 

Today I am trying out a new C4 diagramming tool. Its called likeC4.dev. I feel it is a great C4 diagramming tool. 

This is how I am trying it out. 

## Setup
I have node.js already installed and running on my system. 

To draw a diagram its as simple as selecting a folder for the diagram code, defining the diagram code and running a command.

```sh
mkdir c4like-diagrams
cd c4like-diagrams

touch tutorial.c4
```


run likec4

```sh

npx likec4 start

```

Follow the tutorial https://likec4.dev/tutorial/
