## Project Overview

The Zimi Smart Home Voice Assistant Integration project implements comprehensive voice control capabilities for Zimi smart electrical devices through both Google Home and Amazon Alexa platforms. The project features a sophisticated backend architecture with unified business logic and platform-specific translation layers to ensure consistent functionality across voice assistant ecosystems while maximizing code reuse and maintainability.

## The Challenge

Integrating Zimi smart devices with multiple voice assistant platforms presented unique architectural challenges:

- **Platform Diversity**: Google Home and Alexa have different API structures, request/response formats, and authentication flows
- **Code Duplication**: Risk of maintaining separate implementations for each platform
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Device state changes from Zimi backend must be instantly reflected across all voice platforms
- **OAuth Complexity**: Secure account linking between voice assistants and Zimi user accounts
- **Consistent Behavior**: Ensuring identical device control experience across different voice ecosystems

## Architecture & Design

### Unified Translation-Based Architecture

The core innovation was designing a translation-based architecture that converts platform-specific requests into a common internal format:

- **Translation Layer**: Converts Google Home and Alexa requests into common internal format
- **Common Business Logic**: Unified processing engine handling device operations regardless of source platform
- **Response Translation**: Converts common internal responses back to platform-specific formats
- **Shared Components**: Device state management, user authentication, and command processing logic reused across platforms

### Authentication Layer

**OAuth 2.0 Integration**: Both Google Home and Amazon Alexa authenticate users through OAuth flows to link Zimi user accounts with their respective smart home platforms, enabling secure device access and control through centralized token management.

### System Components

**Platform Translation Services**
- Google Home Translator: Handles conversion between Google Actions format and common format

- Bidirectional Processing: Supports both request translation and response formatting

**Common Business Logic Engine**
- Device Manager: Unified device discovery, state management, and command processing
- User Manager: Permission validation and account management across platforms
- State Engine: Centralized device state tracking and command execution

**Real-time Event System**
- Event Handler: Processes device state changes from Zimi backend
- Event Translator: Converts internal events to platform-specific formats
- Push Service: Distributes real-time updates to Google Home and Alexa platforms

## Implementation Details

### Google Home Integration

**Supported APIs**
The Google Home integration implements the complete Actions on Google Smart Home API:

- **Sync**: Discovers and registers user's Zimi devices with Google Home
- **Query**: Retrieves current device states for status inquiries
- **Execute**: Processes voice commands to control devices
- **Disconnect**: Handles account unlinking and device removal

**Request Translation Implementation**
```typescript
// Convert Google Home format to common format
const translateGoogleRequest = (googleRequest: GoogleSmartHomeRequest) => {
  const { inputs, requestId } = googleRequest;
  
  for (const input of inputs) {
    switch (input.intent) {
      case 'action.devices.SYNC':
        return createCommonSyncRequest(input, requestId);
      case 'action.devices.QUERY':
        return createCommonQueryRequest(input, requestId);
      case 'action.devices.EXECUTE':
        return createCommonExecuteRequest(input, requestId);
    }
  }
};

// Convert common response to Google format
const translateToGoogleResponse = (commonResponse: CommonResponse) => {
  return {
    requestId: commonResponse.requestId,
    payload: formatGooglePayload(commonResponse.data)
  };
};
```

### Amazon Alexa Integration

**Supported APIs**
The Alexa integration implements the Smart Home Skill API:

- **Discovery**: Discovers and registers user's Zimi devices with Alexa
- **Control**: Executes voice commands to control devices
- **Query/ReportState**: Retrieves current device states for status inquiries
- **Authorization**: Manages OAuth and account linking

**Request Translation Implementation**
```typescript
// Convert Alexa format to common format
const translateAlexaRequest = (alexaDirective: AlexaDirective) => {
  const { header, endpoint, payload } = alexaDirective;
  
  switch (header.name) {
    case 'Discover':
      return createCommonDiscoveryRequest(alexaDirective);
    case 'TurnOn':
    case 'TurnOff':
      return createCommonControlRequest(alexaDirective);
    case 'ReportState':
      return createCommonQueryRequest(alexaDirective);
  }
};

// Convert common response to Alexa format
const translateToAlexaResponse = (commonResponse: CommonResponse) => {
  return {
    event: {
      header: createAlexaHeader(commonResponse),
      endpoint: formatAlexaEndpoint(commonResponse),
      payload: formatAlexaPayload(commonResponse.data)
    }
  };
};
```

### Common Business Logic Engine

The unified processing engine handles all device operations through a standardized interface:

```typescript
// Common request processor
const processCommonRequest = async (commonRequest: CommonRequest) => {
  // Validate user permissions
  await validateUserAccess(commonRequest.userId, commonRequest.deviceIds);
  
  // Process device operations through Zimi backend
  const result = await executeDeviceOperation(commonRequest);
  
  // Return standardized response
  return createCommonResponse(result);
};

// Device operation execution
const executeDeviceOperation = async (request: CommonRequest) => {
  switch (request.operation) {
    case 'sync':
      return await syncUserDevices(request.userId);
    case 'query':
      return await queryDeviceStates(request.deviceIds);
    case 'execute':
      return await executeDeviceCommands(request.commands);
  }
};
```

## Real-time State Synchronization

### Event Processing Pipeline

The system implements comprehensive real-time state synchronization to keep all platforms updated when device states change:

**Backend Event Handler Integration**
```typescript
// Process device state changes from Zimi backend event handler
const handleDeviceStateChange = async (deviceEvent: DeviceStateEvent) => {
  // Update internal device state
  await updateDeviceState(deviceEvent.deviceId, deviceEvent.newState);
  
  // Translate to platform-specific events
  const googleEvent = translateToGoogleStateEvent(deviceEvent);
  const alexaEvent = translateToAlexaStateEvent(deviceEvent);
  
  // Forward to respective platforms
  await sendGoogleStateReport(googleEvent);
  await sendAlexaChangeReport(alexaEvent);
};

// Event translation for Google Home
const translateToGoogleStateEvent = (deviceEvent: DeviceStateEvent) => {
  return {
    requestId: generateRequestId(),
    agentUserId: deviceEvent.userId,
    payload: {
      devices: {
        states: {
          [deviceEvent.deviceId]: formatGoogleDeviceState(deviceEvent.newState)
        }
      }
    }
  };
};

// Event translation for Alexa
const translateToAlexaStateEvent = (deviceEvent: DeviceStateEvent) => {
  return {
    event: {
      header: {
        namespace: getAlexaNamespace(deviceEvent.deviceType),
        name: 'ChangeReport',
        messageId: generateMessageId()
      },
      endpoint: {
        endpointId: deviceEvent.deviceId
      },
      payload: formatAlexaChangePayload(deviceEvent.newState)
    }
  };
};
```

### State Distribution System

**Push Service Implementation**
- **Google Home**: Uses Report State API to push real-time device state updates
- **Amazon Alexa**: Uses Alexa Event Gateway to send change reports
- **State Synchronization**: Ensures all platforms maintain consistent device state information

```typescript
// Push state updates to platforms
const pushStateUpdates = async (deviceEvent: DeviceStateEvent) => {
  // Send to Google Home Report State API
  await axios.post('https://homegraph.googleapis.com/v1/devices:reportStateAndNotification', 
    googleEvent, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${googleAccessToken}` }
    });
  
  // Send to Alexa Event Gateway
  await axios.post('https://api.amazonalexa.com/v3/events', 
    alexaEvent, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${alexaAccessToken}` }
    });
};
```

## Technical Highlights

### OAuth Authentication Flow

**Secure Account Linking**
```typescript
// OAuth flow implementation
const handleOAuthCallback = async (platform: 'google' | 'alexa', authCode: string) => {
  // Exchange authorization code for tokens
  const tokens = await exchangeAuthCode(platform, authCode);
  
  // Link user accounts
  await linkUserAccounts(tokens.userId, platform, tokens);
  
  // Return success response
  return { linked: true, platform };
};
```
