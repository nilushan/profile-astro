                I specialize in full-stack web applications, cloud architecture (particularly GCP), IoT platforms, 
                and real-time systems. I'm particularly passionate about projects involving TypeScript, React, 
                Node.js, and scalable cloud infrastructure. I also enjoy working on complex technical challenges 
                that require innovative solutions.

                Yes, I'm very comfortable with remote work and have been working remotely successfully for several years. 
                I'm experienced with distributed teams and asynchronous communication. I'm based in Queensland, Australia, 
                but I'm flexible with time zones for international collaboration.

                I prefer email for initial contact and detailed discussions. For ongoing projects, I'm comfortable 
                with Slack, Microsoft Teams, or similar platforms. I believe in clear, regular communication and 
                am always available for video calls when needed to discuss complex technical matters.

                Yes, I offer technical consulting services including architecture reviews, code audits, 
                cloud migration planning, and technology strategy. I can also provide mentoring for development

                Project timelines vary greatly depending on scope and complexity. I believe in agile development 
                with regular milestones and deliverables. For new projects, I typically start with a detailed 
                discovery phase to understand requirements and provide accurate estimates. I'm committed to 
                delivering quality work on time and within budget.
